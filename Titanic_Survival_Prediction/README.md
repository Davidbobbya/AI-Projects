# Titanic-logistic-regression
A classic machine learning project that predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. This project demonstrates the complete workflow of a binary classification problem â€” from data preprocessing to evaluation using logistic regression.

Dataset:
I have taken dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data

Goal:
To predict whether a passenger can survive the titanic!

Tools Used:
1.Python - Programming language
2.Google Collab - Development Environment
3.Pandas, Numpy - Data loading & preprocessing
4.Seaborn,Matplotlib - Data visualization
5.Scikit-learn - Model Training and Evaluation

Algorithm:
1.Logistic Regression

Features:
1.Pclass - Passenger class               
2.Sex - Gender (encoded as 0/1)       
3.Age - Age of passenger              
4.SibSp - # of siblings/spouses aboard  
5.Parch - # of parents/children aboard  
6.Fare - Ticket fare                   
7.Embarked - Port of embarkation (one-hot) 


Evaluation Metrics: 
1.Accuracy
2.Confusion Matrix
3.Precision, Recall, F1 Score(Classification Report)

Model Performance:
Accuracy ~ 81%
